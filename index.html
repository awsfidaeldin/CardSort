                            <section id="ulist2">
                                <ul>

                        <h3>Methodology and Personal Feedback:</h3>
                        <p>
                            The card sort assignment involved interviewing two students. The two students (Ramia and Juan) have been previously interviewed for the Empathy Map activity. A Brief description about the card sorting activity have been explained to the two students. Guiding both of the students to understand the card sort software by walking them step by step through the card sort activity, and also explaining the benefits of card sorting on information architecture. The first student (Juan) has been monitored while going through the card sorting and the questionnaire tasks. The second student (Ramia) performed the same steps to accomplish both of the card sorting and the questionnaire. 
                            The card sorting and the questionnaire results for both students were completely different. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In my personal opinion, each student had his own personal view, needs, and expectations about the educational website for the Cisco courses and how will the website look like at the end. 
                            The first student (Juan) took more time in sorting and labeling the cards, and also in the questionnaire, while the second student (Ramia) took less time in performing the same tasks. The main reason behind that was Juan's concerns about the over all layout of the previous MyPath website. 
                        </p>
                        <p> My findings from the card and label sorting activity along with the questionnaire have definitely changed my initial thoughts about designing and grouping the components of the Cisco educational website for the college students. One of the most important aspects of this survey was finding the reasons behind using the Cisco website by the IT students to learn Cisco courses. Another important aspect is how the menus and links will be ordered according to their importance to the student's point of view. </p>
                        <p>
                            In summary, the card sort activity has a big role in information architecture in terms of grouping the content by the end users, and also the way information will flow on the website.
                        </p>
